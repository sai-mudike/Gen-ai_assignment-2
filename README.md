# **Assignment 2 – Practical Learning in Prompt Engineering for Requirement Analysis**  

## **Overview**  

This project is part of Assignment 2, which helps us learn prompt engineering through practical work. The main goal is to explore different ways to make requirement analysis simple and effective. The project helps improve the accuracy and clarity of software requirement extraction by using structured prompts.  

For this, experiments were done using Ollama, a platform for running AI models, to generate and refine software requirements. Different techniques were tested, such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Automated Prompting.  

### **Use Case – Pastpal**  

Pastpal is a Discord chatbot that helps students learn history in a fun and engaging way. It breaks down complex historical events, concepts, and timelines into simple explanations. To improve the chatbot, structured prompt techniques were used to analyze requirements and keep the documentation clear and well-organized. 

## **Techniques Explored**  

The project tested and studied different prompt engineering techniques, including:  

- Zero-Shot Prompting  
- Self-Consistency Prompting  
- Prompt Template Prompting  
- Meta Prompting  
- Few-Shot Prompting  
- Chain-of-Thought Prompting  
- Role-Playing Prompting  
- Instruction-Based Prompting  
- Recursive Prompting  
- Contrastive Prompting  
- Iterative Refinement Prompting  
- Automated Prompting (Level-0, Level-1, and Level-2) for Requirement Analysis  

Each method was evaluated based on how accurately it extracted requirements, how quickly it responded, and how complete the results were.  

## **Implementation**  

Ollama was used in this project to run AI models and generate automated responses. Various prompting methods were tried, such as changing model settings to improve the outcomes. The results highlight how structured prompts can help make requirement analysis more straightforward and effective in software development.
