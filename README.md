# Assignment 2 – Hands-On Prompt Engineering for Requirement Analysis  

## Overview  

This project is part of Assignment 2 – Hands-On Prompt Engineering for Requirement Analysis. The objective is to explore various prompt engineering techniques to automate and enhance the requirement analysis process. By leveraging AI-driven prompting methods, the project aims to improve efficiency, accuracy, and completeness in extracting software requirements.  

The experiments are conducted using Ollama, an AI model execution platform, to generate, refine, and analyze requirements using structured prompts. The techniques tested include Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and various levels of Automated Prompting.  

## Use Case – Pastpal  

Pastpal is a Discord-based chatbot designed to assist students in learning history in an interactive and engaging manner. The chatbot simplifies complex historical events, concepts, and timelines, making them easier to understand. To enhance its development, AI-driven prompt engineering is applied to automate the requirement analysis process, ensuring clear, structured, and comprehensive requirement documentation.  

## Techniques Explored  

The following prompt engineering techniques were tested and analyzed in this project:  

- Zero-Shot Prompting  
- Self-Consistency Prompting  
- Prompt Template Prompting  
- Meta Prompting  
- Few-Shot Prompting  
- Chain-of-Thought Prompting  
- Role-Playing Prompting  
- Instruction-Based Prompting  
- Recursive Prompting  
- Contrastive Prompting  
- Iterative Refinement Prompting  
- Level-0, Level-1, and Level-2 Automated Prompting for Requirement Analysis  

Each technique was evaluated based on accuracy, response latency, and completeness in requirement extraction.  

## Implementation  

This project utilizes Ollama for executing AI models and generating automated responses. Different prompting strategies were tested by varying model parameters to optimize performance. The results demonstrate how AI-driven requirement analysis can improve the software development process.
