    "### Performance and Behavior Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Level-1 Prompt Works Well**: The first step creates a clear and organized prompt for analyzing Pastpal's requirements, which helps guide the process effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Level-2 Prompt Gives Detailed Results**: Using the Level-1 prompt, the second step provides a complete analysis, covering functional, non-functional, and integration needs.\n",

    "3. **Clarity Matters**: If the Level-1 prompt is unclear, the Level-2 results may not be as accurate or useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Longer Process, More Resources**: Chaining prompts together uses more resources and can slow things down. It also risks losing focus if not managed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Potential Issues**: Over multiple steps, the analysis might drift from the original goal, and small errors can add up, reducing accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Improvements Possible**: Adding feedback loops and tweaking settings (like temperature or context size) could make the process more consistent and reliable in the future.\n",
